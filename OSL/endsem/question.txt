Efficient page replacement algortihm : There are 3 frames. 
i)  Write a C program to implement LRU. Idendicate hit/fault after every page check.
ii) Modify the above program such that if 4 page faults occur back to back, then switch the algorithm to Optimal page replacement. 
    While operating with Optimal page replacement, if 3 page faults occur back to back, then switch back the page replacement algorithm to LRU.
    If there occurs 4 page faults during LRU and it is not possible to implement Optimal page replacement algorithm then switch to FIFO page replacement algorithm.
