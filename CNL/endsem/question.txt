CNL endsem exam:

1 Question for write-up only + 1 Question for write-up and execution.
Total duration: 120 minutes.

1) Write-up only: It was a question on NS2. 
   - There were 5 nodes(0-4) and we were asked to write the code to set up a little complex wired network topology for TCP_FTP traffic and UDP_CBR traffic 
   between the specified nodes.
   
2) Write-up + Execution:
   - We had to setup a GNS configuration(as shown in GNS.png file). 
   - IPs of all PCs had to be assigned dynamically using the DHCP server. 
   - Inter-group ping(within group1 only or within group2 only) and Intra-group ping(between group1 and group2) on the PCs should be able to capture packets 
     successfully.
   - Setup serial interface configuration between DNS router and the DHCP router.
   - DNS server should resolve Lab1.com, Lab2.com, Lab3.com via routers R3, R4, R5 respectively.
