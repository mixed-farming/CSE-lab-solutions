Write a concurrent client-server program which accepts an array of 6 odd numbers in the interval (x,y) from client element by element, where 
x and y is the input on the client side and they specify the range of input. The server should be able to manage exactly two client requests and should send back 
to the client the sorted array.

eg : 
x=20, y=50

input : 21, 49, 59, 57, 55, 53, 51, 23, 47, 25, 45
output : 21, 23, 25, 45, 47, 49
