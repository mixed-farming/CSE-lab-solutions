Write a cuda program to take input of a string with multiple words of different lengths, a character ('R'/'L'), a number 'n' and
by using a 1D grid and 2D block design a functioning kernel which rotates each word in the string sentence 'n' number of times 
either in right(R) direction or in left(L) direction as specified by user in inputs. Also show the number of words present in the sentence, length of each word and
the length of the largest word. Use number of words as grid dimension and length of largest word as the number of threads in a block(2D alignment of 
threads is upto the you. Suppose longest word is of length = 8, block dimension can be either 4*2 or 2*4). Make sure extra threads in every block aren't doing any work.

example:
1) 
string: manoj mpi cuda parallel
character: R
n=3
o/p: 
4 words
lenghts : 5 3 4 8
longest word : 8
string : nojma mpi udac lelparal

2)
string: how are you
character: L
n=2
o/p: 
3 words
lenghts : 3 3 3
longest word : 3 
string : who ear uyo
