CDL endsem exam:

1st Question for write-up only
2nd Question for write-up and execution 
3rd Question for execution only

Total duration: 120 minutes ( + 5 minutes buffer time if you are fortunate :) )

We were a given a grammar with 7 productions (consisting of left recursion and left factoring).
1) Write a flex program to generate the tokens.
2) Write and implement a GetNextToken for the same grammar and show the output in the form:
   static-keyword
   manoj-id
   10-number...
3) Implement a recursive decent parser(RDP) for the same grammar and check for parsing actions 
   showing errors with appropriate messages on incorrect inputs and 'Success' on correct input.
